# Macroni

Yank your macros to an easily mappable format for future use in Neovim!

## Usage

Simply run `:YankMacro [register]` to yank a recorded macro from a register, then paste the macro directly into a custom mapping in your config ðŸ¤Œ

### Example

For example, say we record a short macro to the `q` register to make a todo list item on the current line. We can then run `:YankMacro q`, and paste into a mapping like so:

```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>t', '^i-<Space>[<Space>]<Space><Esc>', { remap = true })
```

_Note: It is recommended that you set the `remap = true` option, to ensure that your macro is run more accurately as if you had manually run it yourself!_

### Advanced Usage

You can also use macroni's `run()` helper to execute the macro from within a function:

```lua
local make_todo_list_item = function ()
  require('macroni').run('^i-<Space>[<Space>]<Space><Esc>')
end

vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>t', make_todo_list_item, { remap = true })
```
